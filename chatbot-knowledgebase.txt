Process Description:
"Five-Step Transformation: From Waste to Worth"
Our proprietary process transforms diverse textile waste streams into market-ready products through controlled mechanical recycling, quality-assured processing, and sustainable manufacturing.
Collection Sources:
•	Garment Factories: Pre-consumer waste from Ahmedabad's textile corridor
•	Rag Dealers: Post-consumer textiles through established networks
•	Post-Consumer Partnerships: Direct collection from retail and hospitality sectors
•	CSR Initiatives: Corporate waste management contracts
Detailed Process Steps:
1. Collection & Sorting
Multi-stream waste collection using color-coding and fiber type identification. Advanced sorting separates cotton, polyester, blends, and contaminated materials. Quality control ensures only processable materials enter production.
2. Shredding & Fiber Opening
Industrial shredders reduce textiles to manageable sizes while fiber opening machines separate and clean individual fibers. Contamination removal and length standardization prepare materials for downstream processing.
3. Carding for Fiber Output
Carding machines align fibers, remove remaining impurities, and create consistent web formation. Output includes recycled staple fiber (1.5-15 dtex) suitable for nonwoven, stuffing, and industrial applications.
4. Pulping/Molding for Packaging
Cotton-rich streams undergo pulping for paper-based packaging products. Molded fiber tray production includes food-contact certification processing for FSSAI compliance.
5. Baling/Packing & Dispatch
Final products undergo quality testing, proper packaging, and logistics coordination. Carbon credit documentation and customer delivery complete our value chain.
